# JavaChessEngine
In-Progress Chess Engine Developed With The MiniMax Algorithm

EVALUATION Method:  
Evaluation is between a number between -1 and 1.   
Any number above 0 means white is winning. 1 is checkmate for white  
Any number below 0 means black is winning. -1 is checkmate for black  
0 is an even game  


ROADMAP:
- GUI ✅ (10/01/24)
- Input with FEN Notation✅ (07/01/24)
- Basic Evaluate Function ✅ (08/01/24)
  
Engine (IN PROGRESS)
- Calculate Possible Moves Function (IN PROGRESS)
- isCheckmate Function
- MiniMax Algorithm
- Alpha-Beta Pruning
  
- Proper Evaluate Function
(The basic evaluate function is solely based on material, and nothing else. This is to faciliate the development of the minimax algorithm, then a proper evaluate function will be built.)

- OUPUT FEN NOTATION
- Ability to Play Moves Directly On Panel
