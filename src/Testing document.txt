Different types of moves:
isCastle - 4 different types
isEnPassant & isCapture
isEnPassant
isPromote
isCapture
normal move



isCastle WORKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
public Move(boolean isCastle, boolean isKingSide) {

enPassant + Capture WORKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
 public Move(int startX, int startY, int endX, int endY, int enPassantPieceActualX, int enPassantPieceActualY) {

isEnpassant WORKSSS
    public void pawnMovedTwice()


isPromote WORKS
    public Move(int startX, int startY, int endX, int endY, boolean isCapture,
        boolean isPromote, String promotePiece) {



isCapture / normal move WORKS
    public Move(int startX, int startY, int endX, int endY, boolean isCapture) {


If there are any issues, it will be only with the updateMoves()


Some other things to take note:
the castling rights don't update if the rook is captured






Where I left off:
MakeMoves is wrong, and it actually passes by reference pointers
so putting new Piece() will change the object passed in. Probably
need to create a new function to copy object data
